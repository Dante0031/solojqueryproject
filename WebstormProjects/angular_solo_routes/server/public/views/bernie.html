<img class="bernie" src="./assets/images/bernie.jpg"></img><p>Bernard "Bernie" Sanders (born September 8, 1941) is an American politician and the junior United States senator from Vermont. A Democrat as of 2015,[5] he had been the longest-serving independent in U.S. Congressional history. Sanders has been the ranking minority member on the Senate Budget Committee since January 2015.[6] He is a candidate for President of the United States in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

    Sanders was born and raised in the borough of Brooklyn, in New York City. He graduated from the University of Chicago in 1964. While a student, Sanders was a member of the Young People's Socialist League and an active civil rights protest organizer for the Congress of Racial Equality and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee.[7][8] In 1963, he participated in the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom where Martin Luther King, Jr. gave his "I Have a Dream" speech.[7]

    After settling in Vermont in 1968, Sanders ran unsuccessful third-party campaigns for governor and U.S. senator in the early to mid-1970s. As an independent, he was elected mayor of Burlington, Vermont's most populous city, in 1981. He was reelected three times. In 1990, he was elected to represent Vermont's at-large congressional district in the U.S. House of Representatives. In 1991, Sanders co-founded the Congressional Progressive Caucus. He served as a congressman for 16 years before being elected to the U.S. Senate in 2006. In 2012, he was reelected by a large margin, capturing almost 71% of the popular vote.

    Sanders has long been critical of U.S. foreign policy, and was an early and outspoken opponent of the Iraq War. He rose to national prominence following his 2010 filibuster[9][10] against the proposed extension of the Bush tax cuts. Sanders favors policies similar to those of social democratic parties in Europe, particularly those instituted by the Nordic countries.[14] He is a leading progressive voice on issues such as income inequality,[15] universal healthcare, parental leave, climate change,[16] LGBT rights, and campaign finance reform.[17] He is also outspoken on civil rights and civil liberties, and has been particularly critical of racial discrimination in the criminal justice system[18] and mass surveillance policies such as the USA PATRIOT Act[19] and the NSA surveillance programs.[20]</p>
